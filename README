This is a fork of the CL-SMTP library (http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-smtp/)
It is maintained by Hans HÃ¼bner and has a few features that have not been merged
into the upstream version, most prominently the WITH-SMTP-MAIL function.  Both
versions have diverged significantly, with the upstream version being maintained
more, with a focus on MIME mail generation.  This versin is more concerned with 
the SMTP aspects and meant to be used with a MIME message generation library
like cl-mime.

For all questions or comments regarding this version, please contact
hans.huebner@gmail.com.
